# Video Downloader and Concatenator
This Python script allows you to download and concatenate .ts video files from multiple sources into a single video file.

## How It Works
Input File: Provide a text file (inputs.txt) containing a list of video sources along with their corresponding folder names. Each line in the file should follow the format: folder_name,video_source_url.
Download Process:
The script parses each URL to extract video IDs and titles.
It then downloads each video file in .ts format from the provided sources concurrently using multi-threading for faster processing.
Concatenation:
Once all video files are downloaded, they are concatenated into a single .ts file named all_videos.ts.
The temporary .ts files are then removed.
## Usage
 Clone the repository:
 bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the directory:
bash
Copy code
cd <repository_directory>
Add your video sources to inputs.txt.
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python video_downloader.py
After execution, the concatenated video file all_videos.ts will be available in the directory.
